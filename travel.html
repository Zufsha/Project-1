  <h1> Destinations Around the World</h1>
  <h2>Tokyo</h2>
  <h3>A little about Tokyo</h3>
  <p>The most populous city in the world and the capital of Japan is Tokyo. It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures and is made up of numerous cities, towns, and villages west of the city center in addition to 23 central city wards.Visitors to Tokyo have what seems like an endless variety of options for dining, entertainment, shopping, and culture.</p>
  <p> I always wanted to vist tokyo because of it's variety of options that are presented. I grew up watching anime and most animes takes place in tokyo. It is my dream to go see it live through Tokyo.</p>
  
  <h2>Norway</h2>
  <h3>A little about Norway</h3>
  <p>The western half of the Scandinavian peninsula is occupied by the northern European nation of Norway. The capital city of Oslo and the region to its extreme south are home to about half of the nation's population. Norway is made up of around two-thirds mountains, and some 50,000 islands are scattered along its heavily indented coastline, off deep glacial fjords.</p>
  <p> I have a friend that lives in Norway and he showed me pictures of Norway and it's Northern Lights. It  has beautiful senary with mountains. </p>
  
  <h2>Paris</h2>
  <h3>A little about Paris</h3>
  <p> The alluring City of Light home to world-famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, and the Arc de Triomphe. But the city also offers charming cafes, bustling markets, chic shopping areas, and distinct "je ne sais quoi" that make visitors fall in love with it.</p>
  <p>I know Paris is very famous and it is most people's wish to see paris atlest once in their life but I belive paris has alot more to offer than just the Eiffel Tower. The people, the language, the food and many more. </p>
